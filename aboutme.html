        <p> Carl Creel was a boxer and jailed criminal who becomes the Absorbing Man,
            when he drinks a liquid which the Asgardian god Loki laced with a magic potion.
            Discovering that he could absorb the properties of anything he touched, Creel escapes prison by absorbing
            metal from the guards' bullets and goes on to battle Thor.
