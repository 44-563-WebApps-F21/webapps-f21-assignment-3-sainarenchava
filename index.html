<h1>Algorithm to check if graph is bipartite</h1>
<blockquote cite="https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-1-4419-9863-7_1370">
    A bipartite graph is one whose vertices, V, can be divided into two independent sets, V1 and V2, 
    and every edge of the graph connects one vertex in V1 to one vertex in V2 (Skiena 1990). 
    If every vertex of V1 is connected to every vertex of V2 the graph is called a complete bipartite graph.
