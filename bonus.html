<p>
    James was a baseball player with tremendous speed he would often turn singles to doubles and doubles to triple just on raw speed.
    James got his name because instead of going to the Majors he went to college and majored in engineering.
    James was a track and field star as well and landed him on Sports Illustrated dubbed "The boy most likely to succeed" a nick name James was not found of. On his biggest day a drunk driver Carl Crenshaw took James legs and forced him to his back up in engineering to make his living. 
    And boy did he as he developed a brand of prosthetics called cheetahs made him a millionaire at twenty two.
